## 🚀 Key Features

- **High-Fidelity Backtesting**: Simulates every 5-minute bar with accurate mark-to-market P&L, leg-by-leg exit logic (Profit Take, Stop Loss, Expiration), and price caching to handle data gaps.
- **Phased Serial Optimization**: A custom grid-search engine that optimizes for the **Net Profit / Max Drawdown** ratio. Includes automatic hardware benchmarking and time-to-completion estimation.
- **Fuzzy Intel Engine**: Dynamic position sizing based on VIX regime, IV Rank, and MTF consensus.
- **Alpaca Integration**: Seamless transition to live paper trading using the Alpaca-Py SDK.
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates automated PDF reports with equity curves, strike overlays, P&L distributions, and monthly performance grids.
